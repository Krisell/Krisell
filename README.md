#### 🎉 Current work

 * Full stack web developer and DevOps at <a target="_blank" href="https://teachiq.com">Teachiq</a> in Gothenburg, Sweden.

#### 📚 Education

 * M.Sc. in EE but with my heart in CS (and many extra CS courses). Master's thesis on Cryptograpy.
 * Licensed high school teacher in mathematics and programming. 
 * Endless hours of online courses on Coursera, Udemy, Laracasts etc.
 * Plenty of extra courses within the Swedish higher education system.

#### 💻 Current stack of choice
 * ⚙️ Backend: `Laravel` `(PHP)`, `JS/TS`.
 * 🎨 UI: `Vue.js`, `TailwindCSS`.
 * 💾 Database: Prefering relational, but of course using the right tool for the job.

**Technical goals**: Continue to strive for deep understanding. Contribute more to open source. Especially interested in computer/web security, cryptography.

**Future plans**: I plan on working as a teacher again in the future, but currently the web development world is way too exciting.

**Fun fact**: Competitive powerlifter and absolutely-not-competitive disc-golfer.
